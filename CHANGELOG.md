# Changelog

This file contains notable changes in adam-core

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- `coordinates.residuals.calculate_chi2` now documents and enforces the
  covariance contract required by valid covariance matrices: inputs must be
  symmetric positive definite. Singular or indefinite matrices raise
  `ValueError`; NaN diagonal entries still raise, and NaN off-diagonal entries
  are treated as zero with a warning for legacy compatibility.

## [0.2.4] - 2024-09-20

### Added

- `Observers.from_codes()` method allows creation of observers from equal length arrays of codes and times, to be treated as pairs.
- `SourceCatalog` class has been added to better represent data coming directly from source catalogs.
