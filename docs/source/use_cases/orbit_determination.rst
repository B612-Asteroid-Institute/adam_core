   :description: Orbit determination in adam_core with initial orbit determination and least-squares refinement.

Orbit Determination from Linked Observations
============================================

Problem
-------

You have linked detections and need fitted orbits with quantitative quality
metrics and outlier-aware membership outputs.

What You Get Back
-----------------

The orbit-determination APIs return two synchronized tables:

* ``FittedOrbits``: one row per solved candidate with quality metrics
  (``orbit_id``, ``arc_length``, ``num_obs``, ``chi2``, ``reduced_chi2``,
  convergence/status fields, and best-fit Cartesian state).
* ``FittedOrbitMembers``: one row per observation assignment with
  ``orbit_id`` + ``obs_id`` plus per-observation residuals and outlier flags.

You use them together to rank candidates, inspect residual structure, remove
poor fits, and feed validated solutions downstream.

Implementation Options and Tradeoffs
------------------------------------

* ``initial_orbit_determination`` only:
  Fast triage and coarse fits for many candidates.
* ``initial_orbit_determination`` + ``fit_least_squares``:
  Higher-quality solutions and covariance updates, more compute and tuning.

Runnable Example
----------------

.. code-block:: python

   import pyarrow.compute as pc
   from adam_assist import ASSISTPropagator
   from adam_core.orbit_determination import (
       FittedOrbitMembers,
       FittedOrbits,
       OrbitDeterminationObservations,
       evaluate_orbits,
       fit_least_squares,
       initial_orbit_determination,
   )

   observations: OrbitDeterminationObservations
   linkage_members: FittedOrbitMembers
   # These are typically produced by your detection association pipeline.

   propagator_cls: type[ASSISTPropagator] = ASSISTPropagator

   iod_orbits: FittedOrbits
   iod_members: FittedOrbitMembers
   iod_orbits, iod_members = initial_orbit_determination(
       observations=observations,
       linkage_members=linkage_members,
       propagator=propagator_cls,
       min_obs=6,
       min_arc_length=1.0,
       chunk_size=1,
       max_processes=4,
   )

   propagator = ASSISTPropagator()

   # Inspect top candidates by quality metric.
   ranked_orbits = iod_orbits.sort_by([("reduced_chi2", "ascending")])

   # Refine one candidate orbit with differential correction.
   # (Converts one fitted row to Orbits for the least-squares fitter.)
   fitted_orbit, fitted_members = fit_least_squares(
       orbit=ranked_orbits.take([0]).to_orbits(),
       observations=observations,
       propagator=propagator,
   )

   # Evaluate an orbit set against the same observation bundle.
   evaluated_orbits, evaluated_members = evaluate_orbits(
       orbits=iod_orbits.to_orbits(),
       observations=observations,
       propagator=propagator,
   )

   # Example: count non-outlier members by orbit_id.
   non_outlier = evaluated_members.apply_mask(pc.invert(evaluated_members.outlier))
   print(non_outlier.group_by("orbit_id").aggregate([("obs_id", "count")]))

When to Use This Pattern
------------------------

Use this for candidate confirmation, orbit quality scoring, and iterative
cleanup of observation-to-orbit assignments.
