# adam_core/utils/helpers/data

This directory contains 3 CSVs with data that can be used for testing.

The csv files are generated by running `python get_test_data.py` from this directory.

### objects.csv

Contains a list of object IDs that can be understood by JPL services (Horizons, SBDB, etc). This list
is used to generate the following two CSVs.

### orbits.csv

Each object ID from the list above is queried from JPL SBDB and stored as an `~adam_core.orbits.orbits.Orbits` object.

### elements.csv

The orbital elements in Cartesian, Keplerian, and Cometary representations from JPL Horizons for each object are stored
in this file.
